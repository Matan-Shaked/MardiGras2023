                <div class = "item1"><p>LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell
                represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018. Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined the board of the
                Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004. After the 2005 levee failures in
                Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly
                deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by
                then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans neighborhoods to be
                converted into greenspace.In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with residents and local
                religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor
                residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.</p></div>

                <div class = "item3"><p>Mardi Gras refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning on
                or after the Christian feasts of the Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which
                is known as Shrove Tuesday. Mardi Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating
                rich, fatty foods before the ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten season.
                
                Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and religious obligations
                associated with the penitential season of Lent. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is more usually
                known as Pancake Day or (traditionally) Shrove Tuesday, derived from the word shrive, meaning "to administer the
                sacrament of confession to; to absolve".</p></div>

                <div class = "item5"><p>The festival season varies from city to city, as some traditions, such as the one in New Orleans, Louisiana, consider
                Mardi Gras to stretch the entire period from Twelfth Night (the last night of Christmas which begins Epiphany) to Ash
                Wednesday.Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the Mardi Gras.
                
                In Mobile, Alabama, Mardi Gras–associated social events begin in November, followed by mystic society balls on
                Thanksgiving, then New Year's Eve, followed by parades and balls in January and February, celebrating up to
                midnight before Ash Wednesday. In earlier times, parades were held on New Year's Day. Carnival is an important
                celebration in Anglican and Catholic European nations.</p></div>
